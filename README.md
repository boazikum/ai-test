generate a Python script that will ask the user for a username and password, and then check if the provided credentials match the ones stored in a file called "credentials.txt", Note that the "credentials.txt" file should contain a list of lines, with each line in the format "username:password", if the credentials matchs print out a menu: "1. new flight \n 2. delete flight \n 3. total fuel", if the input is 1 then ask for fight number, duration, type(takeoff/landing), then save as a new file named "*type*-*flight number*.txt" in c:\flights and write inside: "flight number: *flight number*  duratio: *duration*  type: *type*",  if the input is 3 then search all filesin c:\flights with the name "takeoff-number" in the "c:\flights" directory, add the number in the second  row(get the second word) of each file to a variable called "total_fuel", and then print a message with the total fuel value
